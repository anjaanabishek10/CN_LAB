ECHO CLIENT - ECHO SERVER

AIM:
  To write and execute a program for echo client echo server application using TCP.

ALGORITHM:

  CLIENT:
    1. Start.
    2. Create socket.
    3. Establish connection.
    4. Get message.
    5. Send message to the server.
    6. Receive message from server.
    7. Display message.
    8. Stop.

  SERVER:
    1. Start.
    2. Create socket.
    3. Bind socket with IP and port.
    4. Accept connection from client.
    5. Receive message from the client.
    6. Send message to the client.
    7. Close connection.
    8. Stop.

PROGRAM:

  CLIENT:
    import socket
    message = str(input("\nEnter the message...\n"))
    address = ("localhost", 1010)
    port = 10102000
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect(address)
    s.send(message.encode("utf-8"))
    print("\nMessage sent to server from client: {}".format(message))
    print("Message received from server to client: {}\n".format(s.recv(port).decode("utf-8")))

  SERVER:
    import socket
    address = ("localhost", 1010)
    port = 10102000
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.bind(address)
    s.listen()
    print("\nWaiting for connection...")
    client, client_address = s.accept()
    print("\nConnection established on {}".format(client_address))
    message = client.recv(port)
    print("Message received from client to server: {}\n".format(message.decode("utf-8")))
    client.send(message)

OUTPUT:
  >>>python3 server.py
  >>>Waiting for connection...
  >>>Connection established on 127.0.0.1
  >>>Message received from client to server: HI
  
  >>>python3 client.py
  >>>Enter the message:
  >>>HI
  >>>Message received from server to client: HI

RESULT:
  Thus the program for echo client echo server application using TCP was written and executed successfully and the output is verified.

NETWORK COMMANDS: netstat and ifconfig

AIM:
  To study the working of networks commands such as netstat and ifconfig.

COMMANDS:
  netstat
  ifconfig

NETSTAT:
  It is a command used to get information and statistics of protocols and TCP/IP connections in the system.

IFCONFIG:
  It is used to get the information of IP address of a system over the network.

OUTPUT:
  >>>netstat
  Active Internet connections (w/o servers)
  Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State

  >>>ifconfig

  RX packets 61  bytes 7306 (7.1 KiB)
  RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
  TX packets 61  bytes 7306 (7.1 KiB)
  TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

RESULT:
  Thus the networks commands like netstat and ifconfig were studied and executed successfully.
